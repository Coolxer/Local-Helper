# Local-Helper
The mobile application for masses to help local community with different jobs (mainly  in the countryside)

## How it works?
The host creates advertisement about job, that he/she needs your help with. The advert is visible only for users that registered in nearest area (5 km) and they can append to to selected task. Everyone can be host and everyone is the user. The local jobs can be individual (with host / host show only) or gruped.

The main purpose is to help your neihbors and people in your nearest community, especially in the contryside, because there is a lot of small works to do, for example lawn mowing, gardening, work in the field, etc.

## Why people need help ?
The reason someone need help is that he/she is old person, do not have enough time , he/she is lonely, but the work that must be done required group of people.

## Why people want help ?
Everyone is human and understands the needs of others and helping others makes us happy. Especially in the nearest community people know each other and like each other, they are in relationship. If your neighbor helped you, you feel the need to do something for him/her, but actually you dont know what is happening 1 km further, where someone need help. The helping brings people together, friendships are made.
We're giving option to make advertisement with small material reward, beacuse we understand that you invest your time. The host can determine the reward for doing task, so this can be a good odd job, espacially for young persons.
